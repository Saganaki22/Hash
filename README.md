- AES-256 encryption implementation via CryptoJS
- Proper salt handling and storage

### Performance Optimizations
- Debounced input processing for better performance
- Efficient event handling for smooth UI experience
- Optimized animations with transform and opacity
- Minimal DOM manipulations

## üíª Usage

1. Simply open the HTML file in any modern browser
2. Enter text in the input panel
3. Choose encoding or decoding mode
4. Toggle AES encryption if needed
5. View results in the output panel
6. Copy with one click

No installation, server, or internet connection required!

## üîê Security Notes

- This tool operates entirely in your browser - no data is sent to any server
- AES-256 is a recognized standard for secure encryption
- The strength of encryption depends greatly on password complexity
- Password and salt are never stored - they exist only during your session
